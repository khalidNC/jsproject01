      Improvement of the game:
      1. Currently, the score and win/loss/tie shows in popup
      2. Now show these in the webpage
      3. Start adding score first:
        a. After the Scissor button add a p tag
        b. add a class attribute let's name it 'js-score' into the p tag so that we can select the element in JavaScript
        c. Use document.querySelector() to get element in JS.
        d. Then put the score uisng innerHTML = 
        e. This show the score on the page. But this is not updating along with play the game.
        f. To update the score in the page, we need to reuse the same code after updating the score codes.
        g. To avoid the duplication create a new function updateScoreElement() and put the JS score code inside the fucntion. And call the function on above places instead of the codes.
        h. Socor are updating in the page while play the game.
        i. Now to make the Reset button works in the page, call the function updateScoreElement() inside onlick attribute in Reset Score button.

      4. Now put result and moves in the page above the scores display in the page:
        a. First let's a couple of p tags in html codes just above js-score p tag.
        b. first p tag is to display result, so add a class attribut in the p tag named js-result
        c. the second p tag is to display moves again add a attribute here named js-moves.
        d. Now by using DOM put thr result and moves in these p tags.
        e. Scroll down to the codes where we show the result in the popup currently, which is alert. 
        f. here we use the dom - document.querySelector('.js-result')
        g. and change this to results(variable that store results after playing the game) using innerHTML. This display the result in tha page.
        h. Now to display the moves, in same way use dom - document.querySelector('.js-moves')
        i. and change this to playerMove and computerMove. (These are variables and to put these in string use `` stiring.).
        j. results, moves, and score all are displaying in the page.
      
      5. All work in the page so no need to popup now. So delete the popup, whicis alert section from the codes. Save and all works.

    <!-- Add a new button to reset score -->
    <button
      onclick="
      score.wins = 0;
      score.losses = 0;
      score.ties = 0;
      // To remove the localStorage value of score.
      // Save the codes and try to play the game. But it gives an error 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of null'.
      // It is because, when we remove score then the score variable at below has nothing and it is null.
      // To fix this issue we can set a default value when set the score variable with if statement.
      localStorage.removeItem('score');
      // We will call the updateScoreElement() function here after reset score.
      // So that when click on the reset score button in the page it reset to zero in the page.
      updateScoreElement();
    "

      Reset Score
    </button>

    <script>
      // To add a score to the game, we created a variable and store an object into it
      // const score = {
      //   wins: 0,
      //   losses: 0,
      //   ties: 0,
      // };
      // const score = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("score"));
      let score = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("score")) || {
        wins: 0,
        losses: 0,
        ties: 0,
      };

      // Let's get the js-score p element in our JavaScript to show score in webpage.
      // Now we need to put the score inside the p element in JavaScript.
      // And this will put the score in the page but it is not updating after every move. So next step is to update score.
      /*
      document.querySelector(
        ".js-score"
      ).innerHTML = `Wins: ${score.wins}, Losses: ${score.losses}, Ties: ${score.ties}`;
      */
      // So instead of the codes use call the function
      updateScoreElement();

      // To fix the removeItem issue.
      // we use if statement. And change the const to let because, we are reassigning the variable so const score should be chnaged to let score
      // Shortcut way:
      // if (score === null) { we can write this in shortcut way !score
      // Now we can use default oparator,|| as a shortcut to check left side value if falsy then take default value from rightside
      /*
      if (!score) {
        score = {
          wins: 0,
          losses: 0,
          ties: 0,
        };
      }

      // It is now able to save the the last score and display is console.
      // We need to replace the codes score reset to zero with the value from the localstorage.
      // Before doing this we need to convert this to a JS object since localStorage is a string.
      // To do so we call the JSON.parse() method.
      // Then replace the score value reset to zero codes with this localStorage value.
      // console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("score")));

      // Now we need to remove the localStorage as well when we click on the reset score button.
      // Beacuse if we reset and reload the page then start play the game it will grab the score from the localStorage which is the previous score.
      // To do so we remove the localStorage value inside the button above by calling a method localStorage.removeItem() and pass the value we want to remove.

      // Function:
      function playGame(playerMove) {
        const computerMove = pickComputerMove();

        let result = "";

        if (playerMove === "scissors") {
          if (computerMove === "rock") {
            result = "You lose.";
          } else if (computerMove === "paper") {
            result = "You win.";
          } else if (computerMove === "scissors") {
            result = "Tie.";
          }
        } else if (playerMove === "paper") {
          if (computerMove === "rock") {
            result = "You win.";
          } else if (computerMove === "paper") {
            result = "Tie.";
          } else if (computerMove === "scissors") {
            result = "You lose.";
          }
        } else if (playerMove === "rock") {
          if (computerMove === "rock") {
            result = "Tie.";
          } else if (computerMove === "paper") {
            result = "You lose.";
          } else if (computerMove === "scissors") {
            result = "You win.";
          }
        }

        // After every move we will update the score from the result.
        // We will use if statement and check if this is a win, we will update the win property inside the score object by increasing by 1.
        // Here we will save the score in localStorage:
        if (result === "You win.") {
          score.wins += 1;
        } else if (result === "You lose.") {
          score.losses += 1;
        } else if (result === "Tie.") {
          score.ties += 1;
        }

        // LocalStorage:
        // Since the score currently store in a variable so after reloading the page the score deleted and scroe resets to zero.
        // To fix this we will store the score in localStorage so that it does not delete after reloading the page.
        // To do so we will call a function, setItem() inside localStorage object. We need to pass 2 strings here in the function
        // 1. first string is name this is how we access the value that we save later. Let's pass 'message' as the name.
        // 2. then we pass the value that we want to save in the localStorage(it only supports string) let's say we pass the value 'hello'.
        // So this is how we save the value in localStorage.
        // Now let's get out the valu from the localstorage:
        // To do so we need to call another fuction getItem() inside localStorage object. And pass the name, which is 'message' in this case.
        // And print in console

        // localStorage.setItem("message", "hello");

        // get the value out of the localStorage. It prints hello in the console.

        // console.log(localStorage.getItem("message"));

        // Now let's update the game, score with localStorage.
        // pass 'score' as name. and the score variable at the top. But the localStorage only support string so we need convert this to JSON object by using stringify
        // Now save the codes and run the program it will save the score value in localStorage.
        localStorage.setItem("score", JSON.stringify(score));

        // Now, to get the score value out of the localStorage we need to call getItem() method.
        // But we will call this at the top when the page loads it get the value out of the localstorage.

        // The last step is to, not re-seting the score zero everytime rather use the result we get from the localStorage.
        // But the results is string so we need to convert this to an javascript object.
        // And finally, remove the reset zero to the value from localStorage.

        // Update score in webpage: to update the score the above code need to write here and update works.
        // But we notice this is duplication of codes so in this case we can use a function to reuse codes.
        /*
        document.querySelector(
          ".js-score"
        ).innerHTML = `Wins: ${score.wins}, Losses: ${score.losses}, Ties: ${score.ties}`;
