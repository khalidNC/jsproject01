    <h1>What is dom?</h1>
    <p>
      Dom is another built-in object. Called document object.
      <br />
    </p>

    <h1>Example:</h1>
    <p>
      Now if we type 'document' inside the script tag. this is a built-in
      object. And if we right document.body.innerHTML = 'hello' than this will
      remove everything from the page and replace with 'hello'
      <br />
    </p>

    <h1>Let's break down the code document.body.innerHTML = 'hello':</h1>
    <p>
      here document is a built-in object, than a dot notation, means we are accessing a property of the document object called 'body'.
      now the body is also an object and with dot notation we are accessing a body object called innerHTMl. Than with 
      the equal sign we are changing the innerHTMl property to the string hello.
      </body>
      <br />
    </p>

    <h1>Another Example:</h1>
    <p>
      Now another example with document. document.title = 'good job'
      here we are changing the page title property to the string good job.
    </p>

    <button>hello</button>

    <script>
      document.body.innerHTML = "hello";
      document.title = 'good job'
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
