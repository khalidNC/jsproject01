    <h1>What is dom?</h1>
    <p>
      Dom is another built-in object. Called document object.
      <br />
    </p>

    <h1>Example:</h1>
    <p>
      Now if we type 'document' inside the script tag. this is a built-in
      object. And if we right document.body.innerHTML = 'hello' than this will
      remove everything from the page and replace with 'hello'
      <br />
    </p>

    <h1>Let's break down the code document.body.innerHTML = 'hello':</h1>
    <p>
      here document is a built-in object, than a dot notation, means we are
      accessing a property of the document object called 'body'. now the body is
      also an object and with dot notation we are accessing a body object called
      innerHTMl. Than with the equal sign we are changing the innerHTMl property
      to the string hello.
      <br />
    </p>

    <h1>Another Example:</h1>
    <p>
      Now another example with document. document.title = 'good job' here we are
      changing the page title property to the string good job.
      <br />
      <br />
      The document object represents the models of the webpage. And called the
      feature Document Object Model or DOM. DOM combine html and javascript
      together. And JS controlls the webpage.
    </p>

    <h1>
      document.querySelector() method: a method is a fucntion that saved in an
      object.
    </h1>
    <p>
      document.querySelector() lets us get any element from the page and put in
      inside Javascrip. console.log(document.querySelector("button")); here the
      querySelector takes the button element and put into the JS.
      <br />
    </p>

    <button>hello</button>
    <button class="js-button">Second button</button>

    <script>
      // It take string as the element of the page form html body.
      // For example, in this page we have a button called hello. So we pass the button tag in the methon
      // This will takes the first button of the page.
      // Let's print this in console to check.
      console.log(document.querySelector("button"));

      // Now, this document.querySelector("button" is just a JS object, and it has properties, methods that we can use.
      // Every html element has a property called innerHTML, which let us controll the html inside the element.
      // So if we called the innerHTML property for the button it will print the inner html which is "hello" in this case.
      console.log(document.querySelector("button").innerHTML);

      // Adn now we can change this to anything we want. Fior an example
      console.log((document.querySelector("button").innerHTML = "Changed"));

      // now, if we have 2 buttons in the page then how we can select the second one.
      // Problem is query.Selector() select the first button. So the solution is, we can add class attribute to the buttons.
      // so in the openning tag we can added class attribute like; class="js-button" so we are actually lebel the button with js-button.
      // now we can get the second button with the querySelector(). Syntax: document.querySelector('.js-button') so this time we use dot this indicates it is a class attribute.
      // We can print in console. this is calss selector and this is used in css as well.
      // This is the common practice to give the name start with 'js-' so tha it is known that this class is being used in javascript.
      console.log(document.querySelector(".js-button"));

      // Now we know HTML elements are the JavaScript objects. So this'document.querySelector(".js-button")' is an object, and objects are actually values.
      // So we can store the object in a varibale
      const buttonElement = document.querySelector(".js-button");
      // in this case, The variable namming practice is ends with Element/Elem to make it clear  this is an HTML element inside the variable.
      // Now print the variable in console.
      console.log(buttonElement);

      // So what we did?
      // Using the the DOM we can get HTML element inside a page, put it inside a JavaScript, and save it in a variable.
      // So the DOM combines the JS and HTML together.

      /*
      // Print page title using DOM title property in console.
      console.log(document.title);

      // Docuemnt.body: it copy the body of html and put into the script
      document.body;
      // Now print in consloe and see what we see  in console
      console.log(document.body);

      // When we do the above then html body converts to a JS object.
      // For an example, if we print typeof it retunrs object in console.
      console.log(typeof document.body);

      // Use innterHTML property and print in console: and it shows all the codes in body
      console.log(document.body.innerHTML);

      // Now we can change the innerHTML And we can check this on element tab in devtools.
      document.body.innerHTML = "Changed";

      // We can also create new html inside the script using DOM innerHTML.
      // This new button html code we replace all inner html codes.
      document.body.innerHTML = "<button>Good Job</button>";
      */

      /*
      document.body.innerHTML = "hello";
      document.title = "good job";
      */
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
