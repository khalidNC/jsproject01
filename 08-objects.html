    <h1>What is objects?</h1>
    <p>
      Object group multiple values together.
      <br />
    </p>
    <h2>Example of object:</h2>
    <p>
      We are creating a variable and named it product, const product = {} inside
      script tag. This is an object.
      <br />
      Now we can put value inside the curly brackets with key: 'value'/numbers,
      partern like below.
      <br />
      Now print the object in console.
    </p>

    <h2>Built-in object:</h2>
    <p>
      Like conlosle.log() mathod, console is a built-in object. It is provided
      by the language.
      <br />
      There are 2 moe built-in objects:
      <br />
      1. JSON
      <br />
      2. LocalStorage
    </p>

    <h3>JSON Built-in object:</h2>
    <p>
      JSON built in object helps us work with JSON. JSON stands for JvaScript Object Notation.
      <br />
      JSON Syntax:
      <br />
      JSON syntax is similar to javascript object but it has less features. JSON all double qoutes. And JSON does not support functions
    </p>

    <h3>When to use JSON Built-in object:</h2>
      <p>
        Javascrip syntax make sense in javascript. And on the other hand almost all the programming languages understand JSON syntax. 
        <br />
        So JSON is more universal. So we use JSON when we send data between computers that might use different languages.
        <br />
        We also use JSON wehn we store data. Built-in JSON object helps us convert a javascript object to JSON.
        <br />
        For example let's covert product2 obejct to json.
      </p>

      <h3>LocalStorage Built-in object:</h2>
        <p>
          LocalStorage save values more permanently. When we create a variables it only works in the current page. 
          <br />
          For an example: In our rock paper sesiors game we play the game and can see the score but when we refresh the page the score are gone. Because all of the variables are deleted and resets to zero. 
          <br />
          Now we want to save the score in the localStorage so that after refreshing the page it still start from the previous score. 
        </p>

    <script>
      /*
      const product = {
        name: "socks",
        price: 1090,
      };
      console.log(product);
      // now we can access the object by preperty
      console.log(product.name);
      console.log(product.price);

      // Now we can change the value of a property
      product.name = "cotton socks";

      // Now print the object product in console will show 'cotton socks' instead 'socks'
      console.log(product);

      //Add new property
      product.newProperty = "true";
      console.log(product);

      //Remove property
      delete product.newProperty;
      console.log(product);

      // Chaech the typeof the object
      console.log(typeof products);
      */

      // Another object
      const product2 = {
        name: "shirt",
        // We can add property using bracket notation
        // ["delivery-time"]: "1 Day",
        // There is a short-cut if we do not provide the bracket here this will still works
        "delivery-time": "1 Day",

        // Nested object:
        rating: {
          stars: 4.5,
          count: 87,
        },

        // Also we can put a function into a object
        fun: function function1() {
          console.log("Function inside an object");
        },
      };

      // Now print the value
      console.log(product2);

      // Access the property by dot notation is
      console.log(product2.name);

      // Another wany to access property is using squire brackets, called bracket notation
      console.log(product2["name"]);

      // when we will use bracket notation? Let's have an example, try to access a property like delivery-time which should return undefined sicne the property does not exist yet
      // But in this case, it gives an error because JS thinks the 'dash' sing as minus and try to do math.
      // console.log(product2.delivery - time);

      // So in this case, we can use bracket notation that will not give error it will return 'undefined'
      console.log(product2["delivery-time"]);

      // Now access the value of nested object by dot or bracket notation
      console.log(product2.rating.stars);

      // To access the value of a function inside an object by dot or bracket notation,
      // to call the function by dot notation object name then dot then fun(), this call the function and print in console
      // So the function inside am object is called method
      product2.fun();

      // Call a function inside an object using bracket notation
      product2["fun"]();

      // Built-in Object: JSON, LocalStorge.
      // Let's convert product2 object to JSON by using method, JSON.stringify(). 
      // So stringify() is a function that saved inside the JOSN object. And we can call this function using bracket().
      // Inside the bracket we provide the javascript object that we want to convert.
      JSON.stringify(product2)

      // Now print this in console
      console.log(JSON.stringify(product2))
      // Note: in the console we can see the the function inside the javascript object does not appears ins the JSON, it is because JSON does not support function.
      // Note: stringify results the stirng. So if we print typeof the JOSN it will show it is stirng.
      console.log(typeof JSON.stringify(product2))

      // Now let's do opposite. Convert JSON to JavaScript object.
      // To do so we use another buyilt-in JSON object, JSON.parse(). And here we pass the JSON stirng.

      const jsonString = JSON.stringify(product2)
      JSON.parse(jsonString)

      // Let's print in console:
      console.log(JSON.parse(jsonString))

    </script>
