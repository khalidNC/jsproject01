    <h1>What is objects?</h1>
    <p>
      Object group multiple values together.
      <br />
    </p>
    <h2>Example of object:</h2>
    <p>
      We are creating a variable and named it product, const product = {} inside
      script tag. This is an object.
      <br />
      Now we can put value inside the curly brackets with key: 'value'/numbers,
      partern like below.
      <br />
      Now print the object in console.
    </p>

    <h2>Built-in object:</h2>
    <p>
      Like conlosle.log() mathod, console is a built-in object. It is provided
      by the language.
      <br />
      There are 2 moe built-in objects:
      <br />
      1. JSON
      <br />
      2. LocalStorage
    </p>

    <h3>JSON Built-in object:</h2>
    <p>
      JSON built in object helps us work with JSON. JSON stands for JvaScript Object Notation.
      <br />
      JSON Syntax:
      <br />
      JSON syntax is similar to javascript object but it has less features. JSON all double qoutes. And JSON does not support functions
    </p>

    <h3>When to use JSON Built-in object:</h2>
      <p>
        Javascrip syntax make sense in javascript. And on the other hand almost all the programming languages understand JSON syntax. 
        <br />
        So JSON is more universal. So we use JSON when we send data between computers that might use different languages.
        <br />
        We also use JSON wehn we store data. Built-in JSON object helps us convert a javascript object to JSON.
        <br />
        For example let's covert product2 obejct to json.
      </p>

      <h3>LocalStorage Built-in object:</h2>
        <p>
          LocalStorage save values more permanently. When we create a variables it only works in the current page. 
          <br />
          For an example: In our rock paper sesiors game we play the game and can see the score but when we refresh the page the score are gone. Because all of the variables are deleted and resets to zero. 
          <br />
          Now we want to save the score in the localStorage so that after refreshing the page it still start from the previous score. 
        </p>

    <script>
      /*
      const product = {
        name: "socks",
        price: 1090,
      };
      console.log(product);
      // now we can access the object by preperty
      console.log(product.name);
      console.log(product.price);

      // Now we can change the value of a property
      product.name = "cotton socks";

      // Now print the object product in console will show 'cotton socks' instead 'socks'
      console.log(product);

      //Add new property
      product.newProperty = "true";
      console.log(product);

      //Remove property
      delete product.newProperty;
      console.log(product);

      // Chaech the typeof the object
      console.log(typeof products);
      */

      /*
      // Another object
      const product2 = {
        name: "shirt",
        // We can add property using bracket notation
        // ["delivery-time"]: "1 Day",
        // There is a short-cut if we do not provide the bracket here this will still works
        "delivery-time": "1 Day",

        // Nested object:
        rating: {
          stars: 4.5,
          count: 87,
        },

        // Also we can put a function into a object
        fun: function function1() {
          console.log("Function inside an object");
        },
      };

      // Now print the value
      console.log(product2);

      // Access the property by dot notation is
      console.log(product2.name);

      // Another wany to access property is using squire brackets, called bracket notation
      console.log(product2["name"]);

      // when we will use bracket notation? Let's have an example, try to access a property like delivery-time which should return undefined sicne the property does not exist yet
      // But in this case, it gives an error because JS thinks the 'dash' sing as minus and try to do math.
      // console.log(product2.delivery - time);

      // So in this case, we can use bracket notation that will not give error it will return 'undefined'
      console.log(product2["delivery-time"]);

      // Now access the value of nested object by dot or bracket notation
      console.log(product2.rating.stars);

      // To access the value of a function inside an object by dot or bracket notation,
      // to call the function by dot notation object name then dot then fun(), this call the function and print in console
      // So the function inside am object is called method
      product2.fun();

      // Call a function inside an object using bracket notation
      product2["fun"]();

      // Built-in Object: JSON, LocalStorge.
      // Let's convert product2 object to JSON by using method, JSON.stringify(). 
      // So stringify() is a function that saved inside the JOSN object. And we can call this function using bracket().
      // Inside the bracket we provide the javascript object that we want to convert.
      JSON.stringify(product2)

      // Now print this in console
      console.log(JSON.stringify(product2))
      // Note: in the console we can see the the function inside the javascript object does not appears ins the JSON, it is because JSON does not support function.
      // Note: stringify results the stirng. So if we print typeof the JOSN it will show it is stirng.
      console.log(typeof JSON.stringify(product2))

      // Now let's do opposite. Convert JSON to JavaScript object.
      // To do so we use another buyilt-in JSON object, JSON.parse(). And here we pass the JSON stirng.

      const jsonString = JSON.stringify(product2)
      JSON.parse(jsonString)

      // Let's print in console:
      console.log(JSON.parse(jsonString))
      */


      // Auto-Boxing:
      // We already learn object can have property and method.
      // The values might have property and method. For an example,
      // We are going to print "Hello" this string has property length. This will print the charachters numbers for the word Hello.
      console.log("Hello".length);

      // Aother example, the string also has method. Like, we can call the toUpperCase() method using the dot notation. This will print all the letters caplock.
      console.log("Hello".toUpperCase())

      // We might have a question, we know object has property and method but how can a string has property and method?
      // The answer is, the JAvaScript has a special feature call auto-boxing. JS automaticall wrap the string as a special object. This feature is called Auto-boxing.
      // Auto-boxing also works for other type os vales like, numbers and boolean. 
      // Auto-boxing does not work for null and undefined values.


      // Objects are references:
      // To demo this, let's create a variable with an object.
      const object1 = {
        message: "hello"
      }
      // Here, we might think, the object save directly into the variable.
      // But it works little differently. The object save somewhere inside the computer memory and the variable(object1) gets a reference opint to the location of computer memory.
      // This is like a shortcut of a file in computer.
      // Object is a reference because it make the language effecient. For an example. Let's create another varable object2 and reference to object1
      const obejct2 = object1;
      // here object2 is not a copy of object1 it is just a reference pointing to the variable memory and the value is 'hello'.
      // This is how the language become more effecient with references.

      // Interesnting behaviour of references:
      // we can change the value of message property even though we created the variable with const.
      // It is because, this variable is just contain a reference pointing to the computer memory.
      // const preventing to changing the reference pointing to the memory. But it does not prevent to reaching to the point and changing the value.
      object1.message = "Good job!";
      // And print object1 in console it will show the new message "Good Job!"
      console.log(object1);

      // Another Interesting behaviour of references:
      // We can not compare objects directly. for example. create a new object with variable object3 with same value as object1
      const obejct3 = {
        message: "Good job!"
      };
      // Now try to compare object3 to object1.
      console.log(object1 === obejct3);
      // It prints 'false' in console. So it is showing that object1 and object3 are not same even though their value are same.
      // It is because these objects compare the references not the value. And onject3 has a diferent reference than object1 so it show 'false'.
      // Now if we compare object1 with object2 then it will show ture because both has same reference.
      console.log(object1 === obejct2);

      // Shortcuts for objects:
      const obejct4 = {
        message: "Good job!",
        price: 799
      };
      // Create an object as above
      // Now let's say we want to get the message property out of the object and save into a variable with same name as property
      // const message = obejct4.message
      // We can do this in shortcut called distructuring
      const { message } = obejct4

      console.log(message);

      // Destructuring with multiple properties.
      const obejct5 = {
        product: "Rice",
        price: 70
      };

      const { product, price } = obejct5;

      console.log(product, price);

      // Shortcut: Shorthand property
      const object5 = {
        // message: message
        message
        // What is does is the message variable gets into here
        // If print in console it show 'Good job!'
      }

      console.log(object5);

      // Now we have a shortcut of the above code.
      // Since the property and the value name is same so we can write once inside the object. And it is same as above code.
      /*
      const object5 = {
        message
      }
      */

      // Shortcut: Shorthand method:
      const obejct6 = {
        message,
        // method: function function1 () {
        //   console.log("method")
        // }

        // Shortcut of above. This is called shorthand method syntax
        method () {
          console.log("method")
        }
      }

      console.log(obejct6);
      // To call the fucntion
      obejct6.method();

      // We access the function inside the object6 by object6.method and the run it by ()
      // So the function run and print "method" in console.

      // And we have a shortcut of the above codes.
      // Which is inside the object we actualy not need to have the function and function_name
