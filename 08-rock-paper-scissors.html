        // LocalStorage:
        // Since the score currently store in a variable so after reloading the page the score deleted and scroe resets to zero.
        // To fix this we will store the score in localStorage so that it does not delete after reloading the page.
        // To do so we will call a function, setItem() inside localStorage object. We need to pass 2 strings here in the function
        // 1. first string is name this is how we access the value that we save later. Let's pass 'message' as the name.
        // 2. then we pass the value that we want to save in the localStorage(it only supports string) let's say we pass the value 'hello'.
        // So this is how we save the value in localStorage.
        // Now let's get out the valu from the localstorage:
        // To do so we need to call another fuction getItem() inside localStorage object. And pass the name, which is 'message' in this case.
        // And print in console

        // localStorage.setItem("message", "hello");

        // get the value out of the localStorage. It prints hello in the console.

        // console.log(localStorage.getItem("message"));

        // Now let's update the game, score with localStorage.
        // pass 'score' as name. and the score variable at the top. But the localStorage only support string so we need convert this to JSON object by using stringify
        // Now save the codes and run the program it will save the score value in localStorage.
        localStorage.setItem("score", JSON.stringify(score));

        // Now, to get the score value out of the localStorage we need to call getItem() method.
        // But we will call this at the top when the page loads it get the value out of the localstorage.

        // The last step is to, not re-seting the score zero everytime rather use the result we get from the localStorage.
        // But the results is string so we need to convert this to an javascript object.
        // And finally, remove the reset zero to the value from localStorage.
